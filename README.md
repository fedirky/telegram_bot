The telegram_bot project is a console-based Telegram bot for rental services. The bot's core functionality is implemented in the main.py file. It uses the telebot library to interact with the Telegram API, allowing it to process user commands and messages efficiently.

The bot relies on an SQLite database (Shop.db) to store data related to items and other necessary parameters. Additionally, the data.py file contains auxiliary functions or data that support the main bot logic, ensuring smooth operation and structured data handling.
